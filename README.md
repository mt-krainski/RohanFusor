### Development environment ###
This project is fully designed using [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/) and additional modules:
* [assembly2](https://github.com/hamish2014/FreeCAD_assembly2)




### Other important notes ###
* The length of a possible spark, when dealing with HV is approximately  1 cm per 30 kV. Verify (and modify if needed) existing isolations to prevent sparking on connections.
